# Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks (SRCNN)

This project implements a Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) from scratch in TensorFlow 2 / Keras and trains it on a custom LR–HR dataset stored in Google Drive.  
The goal is to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts.

## Features

- **Clean SRCNN implementation** (3-layer CNN based on Dong et al.)
- **Fully Google Colab compatible**
- **Patch-based training pipeline**
- **Metrics tracked:** Loss, PSNR, SSIM
- **Automatic plotting of all metrics**
- **LR vs SR vs HR visualization**
- **Qualitative output results saved to `/content/results/`**
- **Fully reproducible training notebook**

## Dataset

Project uses a downloaded dataset stored in Google Drive.

**Dataset format:**
```
dataset/
  train_lr/   → LR .npy files
  train_hr/   → HR .npy files
  test_lr/
  test_hr/
```
All `.npy` files store images normalized between 0 and 1.

## How To Run On Google Colab (Step-by-Step)

### 1️ Open the Notebook
Open or upload `notebook.ipynb`.

### 2️ Mount Google Drive
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### 3️ Set Dataset Path
Modify dataset path as needed:
```python
DATASET_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/your_dataset_folder/"
```

### 4️ Install Dependencies
```python
!pip install imageio matplotlib numpy tensorflow
```

### 5️ Run DataManager
Loads `.npy` files, extracts random patches:
```python
dm = DataManager(DATASET_PATH)
```

### 6️ Build and Initialize SRCNN
```python
model = SRCNN()
```

### 7️ Training Loop
Patch-based training with MSE + PSNR + SSIM:
```python
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    # Training step
```
Outputs every few steps:
```
Step 80/200 | Loss: 0.00231 | PSNR: 27.8 | SSIM: 0.813
```

### 8️ Save Training Plots
Stored in `/content/plots/`:
- `loss.png`
- `psnr.png`
- `ssim.png`

### 9️ Testing & Result Generation
Generates:
- `/content/results/lr.png`
- `/content/results/sr.png`
- `/content/results/hr.png`

### 10 Visualize Output
Use:
```python
plt.imshow(...)
```

## Training Plots

Three metrics are plotted automatically:
-  Loss vs Steps
-  PSNR vs Steps
-  SSIM vs Steps

Saved to: `/content/plots/`

---

## Qualitative Results

**Sample outputs include:**

|  LR Input   | SRCNN Output | HR Ground Truth |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| ![](results/lr.png) | ![](results/sr.png) | ![](results/hr.png) |

Insert these into your report/paper for qualitative comparison.
